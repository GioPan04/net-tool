# net-tool

Generate network plans from a given JSON


## Getting started

### Installation
- Clone the repo with `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/GioPan04/net-tool`
- Install the dependencies via `npm install` or `yarn`

### Input file
In order to work, net-tool requires a JSON file. The JSON file should contains all the basic info to create the network plan.

You can use the [`example.json`](https://github.com/GioPan04/net-tool/blob/main/example.json) to learn the structure of the file.

### Run the script
You can now run the script via `npm run start input-file.json` or `yarn start input-file.json`
